### Steps to Reproduce

1. Checkout https://github.com/tobiasschaefer/micronaut-parallel-bug
2. Start the application
3. Look at startup time shown in console, e.g. "Startup completed in 10999ms"

### Expected Behaviour

In the class temp.Foo there are two factory beans, both annotated with @Parallel and a Thread.sleep(5000).

I expect a startup time of a bit more that 5 seconds because both should be executed in parallel.

### Actual Behaviour

I see a startup time of a bit more than 10 seconds.
